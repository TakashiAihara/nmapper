# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a continuous LAN network monitoring system built with Node.js and TypeScript. The system will regularly scan the local network to detect devices, monitor their status, and record any changes over time. This enables network administrators and users to track device connectivity, identify new devices joining the network, and maintain a historical record of network topology changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the system to automatically discover all devices on my LAN, so that I can maintain an up-to-date inventory of network devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform an initial network scan to discover all active devices on the LAN
2. WHEN a network scan is performed THEN the system SHALL detect devices using multiple discovery methods (ping, ARP table, port scanning)
3. WHEN a device is discovered THEN the system SHALL collect basic information including IP address, MAC address, hostname, and response time
4. IF a device responds to ping THEN the system SHALL record it as active
5. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL store the discovered devices in a persistent database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the system to continuously monitor the network at regular intervals, so that I can detect changes as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL perform network scans at configurable intervals (default every 5 minutes)
2. WHEN a scheduled scan begins THEN the system SHALL log the scan start time and parameters
3. WHEN a scan completes THEN the system SHALL compare results with the previous scan to identify changes
4. IF the system encounters errors during scanning THEN it SHALL log the errors and continue with the next scheduled scan
5. WHEN the system is stopped THEN it SHALL gracefully complete any ongoing scan before shutting down

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the system to detect and record when devices join or leave the network, so that I can track network topology changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new device is detected THEN the system SHALL record it as a "device joined" event with timestamp
2. WHEN a previously active device no longer responds THEN the system SHALL record it as a "device left" event with timestamp
3. WHEN a device's status changes (e.g., hostname change, different response time) THEN the system SHALL record the change with before/after values
4. WHEN recording changes THEN the system SHALL include device identification (IP, MAC), change type, timestamp, and relevant details
5. IF a device appears offline for multiple consecutive scans THEN the system SHALL mark it as "inactive" rather than "left"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to view current network status and historical changes through a simple interface, so that I can analyze network activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request current network status THEN the system SHALL display all currently active devices with their details
2. WHEN I request network history THEN the system SHALL show chronological list of network changes
3. WHEN viewing device details THEN the system SHALL show device information and its activity history
4. WHEN I request network statistics THEN the system SHALL provide summary information (total devices, recent changes, scan frequency)
5. IF I specify a time range THEN the system SHALL filter results to show only changes within that period

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure monitoring parameters, so that I can adapt the system to my network environment and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from a configuration file
2. WHEN I modify scan interval settings THEN the system SHALL apply the new interval for subsequent scans
3. WHEN I configure network range settings THEN the system SHALL scan only the specified IP ranges
4. WHEN I set timeout values THEN the system SHALL use those values for device discovery operations
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values and log a warning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system operation occurs THEN it SHALL log appropriate information with timestamps
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context
3. WHEN the system starts or stops THEN it SHALL log startup/shutdown events
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt recovery
5. IF log files become too large THEN the system SHALL rotate logs to prevent disk space issues
